In Komodo X, the default color picker got some improvements, but it still does
not support RGBA. (the preview popup supports it, but you can't adjust the
transparency with the picker itself)

[@babobski](//github.com/babobski) solved that problem. His RGBA Colorpicker
is based on [PitPik colorPicker](//github.com/PitPik/colorPicker).

It's very powerful! The most useful feature is adjusting transparency of
current color with a slider. However, there are a lot of other things you may
find useful, but I don't find them useful for me.

### Note

It replaces the default color picker and there's no way to change between them.
If you want to restore the default color picker, just remove this one and
restart Komodo.
