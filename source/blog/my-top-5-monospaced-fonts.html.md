Every developer is facing with a common problem: what font I should use.
Some of them sticks with the defaults (such as Consolas on Windows, Monaco
on OSX and DejaVu Sans Mono on most Linux distros).
Personally I don't like any of them and I decided to write this article to help
you find a good font!

There won't be any screenshots because on different distros/OS's it looks
differently. You'd want to try all of them yourself to find the best one!

# #1: Hack

I found Hack about 5 months ago and since this date it became my favorite one!
It looks awesome and it's in active development! I'm using it everywhere for
monospace styles.
I'm missing slashed zero though in this font, but for the rest it's good
and it supports Cyrillic characters (which is quite important for me).
I've tried to move from it to Anonymous Pro, but it's too hard to do because
Hack looks too damn good!

# #2: Source Code Pro

I was using Source Code Pro before Hack. It's created by Adobe and looks
pretty good imo. But it's too tight for me.
This font is missing slashed zero as well, but it supports Emoji (so someone
who loves emoji in its comments may find this very useful)

# #3: Roboto Mono

This one looks pretty great! It has slashed zero and I probably would use it
if I would find it earlier than Hack. Roboto looks pretty good everywhere, so
you could try to check it out!

# #4: Meslo

Meslo is a customized version of Apple's Menlo font. It ships with 6 versions:

* Dotted/Slahed Zero
* 3 different line heights

I was using it a long time ago until I found Source Code Pro. It looks good and
supports a lot of characters.

# #5: Ubuntu Mono

This one ships with Ubuntu distro and looks pretty good if you're using the
default Ubuntu font smoothing and fonts. When I've switched from Windows to
Ubuntu, I was using it for a long time.
You can download it regardless of your distro/OS
